Build system to directly compile and run c++ programs in sublime. Moreover it uses c++14 directly opposed to the fact that terminal doesnt.

Instructions :
1. Go to View > Layout > Columns: 3
2. Go to View > Groups > Max Columns: 2
3. Go to Tools > Build Systems > New Build System
4. Copy the code from C++14.sublime-build and paste it there and save it by any name.
5. Go to Tools > Build Systems and select your new build system
6. Create 2 files named inputf.in and outputf.in in same directory in which you have your code.
7. Write input in inputf.in, save and run the code in sublime and you will get output in outputf.in .


Tips :
You can use CTRL + shift + B to directly compile run.
You can use 3 pane setup to view code, input file and output file at once (ALT + SHIFT + 3).
