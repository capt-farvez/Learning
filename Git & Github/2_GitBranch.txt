1. Create new Branch:
    git branch branch_name_you_want_to_create
    ==> Press on Enter

    Now we created a new branch

2. Let's confirm that we have created a new branch:
    git branch
    ==> Press on Enter

    Here you will see all the branch and one will be stared(*), means currently which branch you are on.

3. Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the command: (If you need)
    git checkout branch_name_where_you_want_to_go
    ==> Press on Enter

    Switched to branch 'branch_you_provided'

4. Now check the status of the current branch:
    git status
    ==> Press on Enter

5. If we need to add multiple files to the Staging Environment for this branch:
    git add --all
    ==> Press on Enter

    Using --all instead of individual filenames will Stage all changed (new, modified, and deleted) files.

6. We are happy with our changes. So if we need to commit them to the branch:
    git commit -m "Message whatever you want to write"
    ==> Press on Enter

7. Emergency Branch:
    git checkout -b new_brach_name
    ==> Press on Enter

    Now we have created a new branch from current branch and switched on it, and changed to it.
    We can safely fix the error and switch on the new branch without disturbing the other branches.
