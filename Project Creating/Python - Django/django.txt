--> Initial steps for Github :
    1. While create new repository, check mark on gitignore field and replace any to Python by using search field. 
        (To ingore upload the virtual environment on github)



--> Project creation Steps:

    1. Install python extension:
        check if the python is properly installed with following command 
	    $   python --version

    2. Open a new terminal in vs code and create a virtual environment by running the following command-
        $   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        $   pip install virtualenv
        $   python -m venv venv

    3. Then we do run the following command in the terminal. It will run a script to activate the virtual environment-
	    $ .\venv\Scripts\activate

        Sometimes our systems are disabled to run any scripts.
            Fix: 
                1. we need to run the following command in the terminal first-
                    $ Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
                2. Then run the script to activate the virtual environment-
                    $ .\venv\Scripts\activate

    4. Install Django and Create project and App(if needed):
        Open the terminal and run the following commands
	        $ pip install django
            	$ django-admin startproject ProjectName . (do not forget to put the dot at the end)
                $ django-admin startapp AppName

        To Store information about installed packages (Do it everytime when install a new package)
            pip freeze > requirements.txt 
    

    5. To run the server-
        $ python manage.py runserver


--> When try to run the project in another PCs:
        1. Open the project Directory, then create a venv, and run the following command to install packages(installed on project)
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
